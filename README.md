# Predictive-Modeling-of-Corporate-Bankruptcy-Data
Our aim is to build a predictive model based on historical bankruptcy data to determine what financial metrics can predict the likelihood of a business going bankrupt. If a relatively robust model can be developed then companies could be rapidly evaluated for their potential to go bankrupt, and perhaps be offered the opportunity to fix course.
